# Facsimile 0.1 API, SIR Model and Demo Documentation

## FACSIMILE Framework

Model factor creation, composition, extension, rendering and workflow composition are done via API calls to the FACSIMILE framework

[FACSIMILE Framework Documentation](docs/framework.py.md)

## SIR Model 

To demonstrate the use of the API, we created an SIR Model. The factors are built by invoking the FACSIMILE API

[SIR Model definition Documentation](docs/SIRexample.py.md)

## Demo Workflows

We run a couple of workflows based on the SIR model

[Demo documentation](docs/demo.py.md)
